## **4. Installation & Usage**

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/network-analysis.git
cd network-analysis
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Prepare the data**
Ensure that `network_data.csv` is placed inside the `data/` folder.  
Alternatively, **update the file path in `config.py`** if your dataset is stored elsewhere.

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Run the security dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run security_dashboard.py
```

This will:

- Launch an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.
- Show suspicious **IPs, large request sizes, and after-hours activity**.
- **Display charts, tables, and data summaries**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Basic data exploration**
```bash
python -m scripts.data_exploration
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Run exploratory analysis**
```bash
python -m scripts.exploratory_analysis
```
This will:
- Identify **suspicious IPs, large request sizes, and after-hours activity**.
- Generate **basic visualizations** (histogram, country distribution, time trends).

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Perform risk analysis**
```bash
python -m scripts.risk_analysis
```
This will:
- Identify **suspicious IPs**, **large request sizes**, and **after-hours activity**.
- Print **risk summaries** and relevant findings in the console.

(Alternatively, you can try risk_analysis_2.py for a slightly different approach:)
```bash
python -m scripts.risk_analysis_2
```
This will:
- Checks **IP request counts, unusually large requests, and after-hours traffic**.
- Prints a concise **summary of suspicious activities in the console**.
- Perfect for quickly **validating changes in your threshold or focusing on a narrower set of security indicators**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Generate a security report**
```bash
python -m scripts.pipeline
```
This will:
- Run **EDA + Risk Analysis**.
- Create a **security_report.html** with all findings.

## **5.Security Dashboard (security_dashboard.py)**
**security_dashboard.py** is a Streamlit-based interactive visualization tool that enables real-time security monitoring.

**ðŸ”¹ Features:**
- **Suspicious IP Identification.**
- Highlights IPs exceeding a configurable request threshold.

- **Large Request Analysis.**
- Detects unusually large data transfers.
- Displays distribution histograms of request sizes.

- **After-Hours Traffic Detection.**
- Identifies requests occurring outside standard business hours.
- Shows trends over time.

- **Geographical Distribution of Requests.**
- Analyzes client country activity.
- Displays a bar chart of top request origins.

**ðŸ”¹ Run the Security Dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run security_dashboard.py
```
The dashboard provides real-time visual insights into security risks.

## **6. Security Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

Based on network traffic patterns, we focus on the following threats:

### ** 1. Suspicious IP Activity**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| High request volumes from a single IP | Implement **rate-limiting** & **IP blacklisting** |
| Repeated requests from unknown locations | Use **geolocation filtering** & **authentication mechanisms** |

### ** 2. Large or Unusual Data Transfers**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Requests with abnormally high data size | **Monitor request sizes** & alert on anomalies |
| Unusual upload/download behavior | **Implement thresholds** & **restrict sensitive endpoints** |

### ** 3. After-Hours Traffic**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| High traffic outside normal business hours | Flag **non-standard working hours activity** |
| Potential unauthorized access attempts | Use **access logs** & **user behavior analysis** |

### ** 4. Anomalous Traffic Patterns**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Sudden spikes in traffic | Detect **DDoS-like activity** & apply **rate controls** |
| Unusual HTTP methods or error codes | Track **potential attacks** & apply **firewall rules** |
