# network-analysis

Welcome to this **Assessment Project**! This repository contains a set of scripts and notebooks to perform exploratory data analysis and risk assessment on network traffic data.

## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates data analysis, logical reasoning, and the ability to identify and mitigate security risks. The main tasks include:

- **Data Analysis**  
  Analyze a provided set of network traffic data and identify potential security risks. Provide comprehensive data analysis, demonstrate logical reasoning in identifying risks, and deliver clear, actionable insights.

- **Risk Identification and Policy Development**  
  Based on your analysis, identify potential security risks and develop a comprehensive security policy to mitigate or prevent them. Clearly explain the rationale behind the proposed policy.

- **Implementation**  
  Implement a solution to address the identified risks based on the analysis.

## 2. Project Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Perform a detailed analysis of the provided network traffic data.  
   - Identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security risks.  
   - Document your process, insights, and findings.

2. **Risk Identification and Policy Development**  
   - Outline potential security risks discovered in the analysis.  
   - Propose a clear and actionable security policy to address those risks.  
   - Justify your policy decisions with data-driven insights.

3. **Implementation**  
   - Develop and showcase solutions that address identified security issues.  
   - Demonstrate how insights from the analysis inform practical remediation steps.

- **data_exploration.py**  
  Minimal script for loading and inspecting the network traffic data. Prints basic info and statistics.

- **eda.py**  
  Contains a function (`perform_eda`) for exploratory data analysis, generating summary stats and plots.

- **exploratory_analysis.py**  
  Command-line script performing a quick EDA (head, info, missing values, duplicates, etc.).

- **pipeline.py**  
  Orchestrates the entire pipeline: loading data, performing EDA, running risk analysis, and generating reports.

- **risk_analysis.py / risk_analysis_2.py**  
  Checks the data for potential security risks such as suspicious IPs, large requests, and after-hours requests.

- **report_generator.py**  
  Generates an HTML report consolidating EDA and risk analysis results.

## 4. How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/network-analysis.git
   cd network-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the data**:  
   Place your `network_data.csv` file in the `data/` folder (or update the path in `config.py`).

4. **Run exploratory analysis**:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.exploratory_analysis
   ```
   - Prints out the first few rows, DataFrame info, missing values, duplicates, and basic statistics.
   - Plots may appear if you have a graphical environment or can be saved to disk.

5. **Generate an HTML report**:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.pipeline
   ```
   - Runs EDA, performs risk analysis, and creates a `security_report.html` file.

6. **Review the findings**:
   - Open the generated `security_report.html` to see summary statistics, missing values, plots, and risk indicators.

## 5. Security Policy and Mitigation Strategies

After reviewing the analysis, consider drafting a security policy that addresses:

- **Suspicious IP addresses**  
  - Implement IP-based rate-limiting or geolocation filters.  
  - Investigate repeated malicious behavior from specific IPs.

- **Large or unusual request sizes**  
  - Implement thresholds or alerts for abnormally large requests.  
  - Investigate potential data exfiltration attempts.

- **After-hours traffic**  
  - Flag or limit requests occurring outside normal business hours if your environment is expected to have low usage then.

- **Other anomalies**  
  - Monitor sudden spikes in traffic (possible DDoS).  
  - Track unusual HTTP methods or response codes.
