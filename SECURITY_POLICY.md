# Security Policy (`SECURITY_POLICY.md`)

A **security policy** is essential to ensure that vulnerabilities identified in network analysis are **mitigated** with effective actions. This document will serve as a **quick reference** to improve system security.

---

## Structure of the Security Policy

The policy should be organized into **four main sections**:

1. **Problem Description**  
2. **Identified Risks**  
3. **Mitigation Measures**  
4. **Technical Implementation**  

---

## 1. Problem Description

Summarize the **problems** detected in the network traffic log analysis. Include information such as:
- **What threats were found?** (Example: suspicious IPs, unusual traffic, large data packets)
- **Examples of suspicious patterns** detected during script execution.

### Example:
> During network traffic analysis, multiple IPs were detected making an **abnormally high number of requests** in a short period. Additionally, **large data transfers** were detected, possibly indicating a data exfiltration attack. Some IP traffic also occurred **outside business hours**, raising suspicions of unauthorized access.

---

## 2. Identified Risks

List the **main risks** detected.

### Example:

| Risk | Impact |
|------|------------|
| High request volume from a single IP | May indicate a **brute force attack** or automated scraping. |
| Large suspicious data packets | May indicate **data exfiltration** or internal movement of sensitive information. |
| Traffic outside business hours | May indicate **unauthorized access attempts** or silent attacks. |

---

## 3. Mitigation Measures

Document **which measures** will be taken to mitigate the identified risks.

### Example:

| Risk | Mitigation Measure |
|------|------------|
| High request volume from a single IP | Implement **Rate Limiting** to restrict suspicious access. |
| Large suspicious data packets | Monitor and set up alerts for **unusual packet sizes**. |
| Traffic outside business hours | Set up an **alert system** and enforce **multi-factor authentication**. |

---

## 4. Technical Implementation

Describe **how** the mitigation measures will be technically implemented.

### Example:

#### Rate Limiting to Block Suspicious IPs
```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=lambda: "user")

@app.route("/api")
@limiter.limit("100 per minute")  # Limits to 100 requests per minute
def api_request():
    return "API Response"
```

#### Monitoring Suspicious Traffic
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("network_data.csv")
anomalous_traffic = df[df["request_count"] > 1000]  # Sets a request limit
print(anomalous_traffic)
```

#### Integration with SIEM (Splunk, ELK, etc.)
- Configure a **log agent** to send alerts to the SIEM.
- Create **dashboards** for real-time monitoring.
